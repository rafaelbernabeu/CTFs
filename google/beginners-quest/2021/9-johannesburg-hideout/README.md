Johannesburg - Hideout

Johannesburg is hot, and you are on your way to the secret lair. It seems like it is well fortified, even though you are expected under the alias of the assassin, perhaps it will be a better idea to sneak inside the lair, unseen? You climb up on a brick wall, and jump over it. On the other side you spot a lot of guards, quick, hide in a bush. Now you have to sneak past the guards into the main building's entrance.
