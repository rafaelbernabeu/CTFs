Shenzhen - Office


Shenzhen - Office
You’re exiting a crowded subway nearby the office that you are about to visit. You are showing the guards your ID and answering a couple of routine questions. They are not impressed, but the gate opens up and you can enter the area despite their doubt. You are not allowed to stroll freely on the company grounds, but are shown around by a woman that stares at you with a crooked smile. At last you're able to talk to the manager, a short man with a white robe and shades: "Greetings, AGENT, You must be thirsty after your long journey? No? You don’t mind if I’ll have something for myself, do you? Good! We have heard about the device that you possess, can I have a look at it. Hmm, it seems that it is encrypted. Help me break this quickly so that we can continue with the analysis."

Challenge: To the moon (misc)
This one is a doozie. We found this weird file on a memory stick with a post-it note on it. It looks like someone was working on a very obscure encryption system. Maybe we can decode it?
